Howdy! 

Welcome to my weather forecast. 

Although I admit the styling leaves much to be desired my functionality is there! 

This is still a work in progress as of my submission as a homework assignment. I will be revisiting this code to add the remaining missed functionality as well as styling. 

Upcoming Features : 
  - A viewable search history
  - A Large display of the current weather for the requested location.
  - fun icons to go with the forecasted weather. 




This application will allow you to search a city and get back the current weather as well as a forecast for the next five days! It is not restricted to the United States so you can look up ANY city in the world.
